## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- responsive
- viewport
- box-sizing: border-box;
- background-picture

### What I learned

It was another productive project for me. I learned how to use responsive desine with viewport  ,so now i can creat site's which is compatible for computers, tablets and mobile phones.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="some html code i am proud of, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css-code
background-image: url(link-of-picture),
    url(link-of-picture);
  background-position: bottom 40vh right 50vw, left 48vw top 50vh;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development
 
 I think that i already get good experience with Html and Css so now i want to learn Javascreapt and connect this 3 languages to each other comprehensively.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43224166/flexbox-layout-with-multiple-rows-having-3-items-in-each/) - This helped me to learn syntax. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand basics of viewport.
